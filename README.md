# console-finances

This project is designed to solve the questions set out in the Module 5 assignment. It primarily uses JavaScript.  

## Description

The project 

Please find a screenshot below of the

It aims to show you my current skills in using the JavaScript that we have learned on the course so far, solving the requirements of the Module 05 Challenge in the EdX Frontend Web Development Bootcamp. 

My biggest challenge was solving 

 I have completed a JavaScript course previously, but I had not encointered some of the syntax required. 

## Usage

Please find a link to the live application here; 



Please open the HTML file in the browser and inspect the page. Then please view the console. You should see the following as the solution to the assignment;

The JavaScript file that logs this code contains comments. The tutor was asked if this was good practice and the advice given was that as I am new to web development, there should be lots of comments at this stage. Hopefully the comments and the commits explain the process I followed to complete the assignment. I have also made notes here to help me remember the process and what the syntax means. 

I have chosen not to recursively recall the function on line 31. I feel that for the user this can get confusing and can feel like you're in an alert spiral. Once they are told about their error they have to re-start the process. The user hasn't gone too far through the process at this point sop hopefully wouldn't feel too frustrated. The alert informs them of the required action. 

## References

I completed the Northcoders pre-work JavaScript module, so I had a foundation knowledge of some of the concepts covered. I have used google a lot this week, including Stack Overflow, W3 schools and MDN web docs. We also used the 1:1 tutor session this week to look at assignment 5. 


## Contributing

I would very much appreciate some feedback on the methods I have used to achieve the task. Is this the most concise code I could have used? I would also like to know if the readme layout and content was appropriate for the task if possible please.
